    <p>I'm extremely excited to finally begin taking the steps to becoming a software developer. I've been an avid gamer all of my life. However,
        once I began learning about the art of programming, I could never look at them as just games anymore. I finally realized the magic that goes 
        behind our favorite pieces of media. I'm trying to become the magician who the consumer never thinks about, but subconciously appreciates.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>I'm an avid coffee drinker.</li>
        <li>I also find the game Red Dead Redemption 2 to be extremely interesting from an aspiring software engineer's perspective. The game is a literal
            simulator. It looks almost identical to reality when ran at high settings. However, the physics and AI mechanics are the most impressive in game.</li>
        <li>As a kid, I was really into PC gaming because I couldn't afford a console. That alone got me very aware of the open source market, and the capabilities of computers.
            When I was 11 my mom couldn't get me a Wii. However, I had a computer, and the curiosity to figure out that I can use open source emulators to run the dolphin app and emulate Nintendo Wii games.</li>
        <li>I currently game on a PS5, however I always wanted to build my own PC and use it to game. Since class is remote, and I have a decent-at-best laptop, I took per scholas as the perfect 
            opportunity to live out that dream. Or the perfect excuse to finally cash out on PC parts</li>
